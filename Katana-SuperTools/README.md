 1. **Overview and Purpose**
    
    The [MaterialXBake](https://github.com/iceprincefounder/selected-sources/tree/master/Katana-SuperTools/MaterialXBake) tools is a Katana Supertools node to bake Katana shading networks into materialx file. Since Arnold support MaterialX, we could make shading pipeline much more flexible.

 2. **Benefit**
    
    In the final lighting shot, we could override the whole shot materials and also override the specified asset look include in Arnold ASS archives.
