## OSL-Shaders
----------------------------------------------
 1. **Overview and Purpose**

    The [OSL-Shaders](https://github.com/iceprincefounder/selected-sources/tree/master/OSL-Shaders) is the general purpose math shader library. There are a lot of shaders we almost use in every asset, the purpose of the OSL-Shaders is to handle and transform the shading pipeline from different application and renderers easily.
 
 2. **By The Way**
    
    Those are a lot of osl shaders I don\`t list here which deal with different project assets translation.
