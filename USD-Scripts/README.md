 1. **Overview and Purpose**
A [USD-Script](https://github.com/iceprincefounder/selected-sources/tree/master/USD-Scripts) library which contents all functionality to translate a Alembic based pipeline into a USD based one, from Maya to Katana.
 2. **Why I wrote**
The purpose of writing those scripts is to learn, test and play with USD project. Just for fun and curious.
